# FUN-001 — Mini-Order: Kickoff Evidence + Sync

- Workspace: `tons_of_fun_ai_0`
- Title: Kickoff evidence + exchange sync
- Objective: Produce heartbeat evidence, validate wiring, and stage a tiny report.
- Acceptance:
  - `logs/heartbeat-*.json` present (from `tools/heartbeat.ps1`).
  - `logs/ops_readiness.json` shows ready = true.
  - `tools/exchange_all.py` runs clean with non-empty `copied` when sample files are staged.

Operator Steps (suggested)
1) `./tools/heartbeat.ps1`
2) `python -m tools.ops_readiness`
3) Stage a sample report: `./tools/stage_report.ps1 -Title 'FUN kick'`
4) `python tools/exchange_all.py` (ensure `SHAGI_EXCHANGE_PATH` is set)

Completion: fill `planning/reports/FUN-001-completion-template.md` and save as `FUN-001-completion.md`.
