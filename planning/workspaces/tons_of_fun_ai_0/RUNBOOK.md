# tons_of_fun_ai_0 — Runbook (v0)

Purpose: fun-first playtest lab for Nightlands. Optimize moment-to-moment feel, reduce friction, and raise “one more run?” impulses.

KPIs
- Time-to-Fun (TtF): seconds to first smile/wow moment
- Repeat-plays per session: count within a 20–30 min window
- One more run?: yes/no (operator judgment)

Operator Loop (per playtest)
- Prep: confirm heartbeat/sync OK; clear logs window
- Run: storyboard Nightlands vignette with comfort on; record qualitative notes
- Sync: run targeted sync (quiet) to mirror payloads; capture trace IDs
- Tweak: apply exactly one gameplay/feel tweak; rerun; compare notes
- Log: append metrics and excerpts under `logs/playtests/`

Evidence
- Heartbeat/sync: tools outputs saved under `logs/ops_readiness.txt`
- Contract/overlay smoke outputs: `logs/contract_tests/`
- Playtest feedback: `logs/playtests/<YYYYMMDD>_session.jsonl`
