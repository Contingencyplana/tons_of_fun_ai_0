# archivist_ai_0 — Runbook (v0)

Purpose: centralize standards, runbooks, and canonical documentation as mass Alfa ramps.

Initial Outputs

- Docs publish plan: offline-friendly build/publish steps and cadence

Operator Loop (spin-up)

- Consolidate runbooks and record sources of truth
- Outline publishing (manual acceptable); capture steps in `docs/publish_plan.md`
- File completion report with links and follow-ups

Evidence
