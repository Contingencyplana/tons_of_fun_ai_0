# Doc Refresh Queue — November 2025

> Keep the canon scrolls in lockstep with Offline Continuity Mode while pivots stay live.

## Ground Rules

- Update highest-signal docs first (README hubs, pivot summaries, alfa map).
- Log each refresh in `exchange/ledger/2025-11.md` with date, scope, and actor.
- Gate merges touching gameplay tooling on corresponding doc alignment.

## Checklist

- [x] Root `README.md` (Offline Continuity Mode, Alfa staging map, doc queue reference)
- [x] `new_major_pivots/README.md` (status badges + completion notes)
- [x] `planning/alfa_slot_map.md` (sync slot ownership + bridge hooks)
- [x] `docs/morningate_reflection_layer.md` (add offline pipeline chapter)
- [x] `docs/player_routing_brief.md` (clarify battlegrid handoff cadence)
- [x] `new_major_pivots/new_major_pivot_5.md` (2025-11-08: logged translator rollout evidence + progress tracker)
- [ ] `war_office/README.md` (embed doc refresh queue summary)
- [ ] `template.md` (refresh ledger logging instructions)
- [ ] `golf_00/delta_00/README.md` (align alfa subcomponents with latest payload flow)

## Notes

- Treat the list as rolling; append new targets when pivots open.
- Use smaller pull requests per work block to keep review pace manageable.
- Coordinate with Toyfoundry/Toysoldiers when documentation impacts their operational runbooks.
- Next target: refresh `war_office/README.md` with the doc queue summary and Pivot Five crosslinks.
