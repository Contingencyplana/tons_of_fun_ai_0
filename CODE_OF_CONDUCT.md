# Code of Conduct

`tons_of_fun_ai_0` is a TONS-of-FUN genesis workspace dedicated to delight-first playtesting. High Command maintains this space under the SHAGI doctrine of responsible collaboration, with added emphasis on joyful, safe experimentation. All contributors—human or machine—agree to the following:

- **Respect and empathy.** Treat fellow collaborators, playtesters, and simulated agents with care; harassment, hostility, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
- **Fun-first mindset.** Prioritise player delight when proposing or reviewing changes. Guard the “one more run?” spirit described in the runbook and flag ideas that erode it.
- **Transparency and traceability.** Capture motivating orders, fun KPIs, and relevant logs with every change so evidence trails remain intact.
- **Safety and guardrails.** Follow the canary, rollback, and exploit gates documented in `RUNBOOK.md` and related pivotal fronts before introducing impactful tweaks.
- **Accountability.** Own your contributions. If mistakes occur, report them quickly and help remediate.
- **Continuous learning.** Offer feedback graciously, accept feedback openly, and evolve the shared doctrine together.

Violations may result in warnings, temporary restrictions, or removal of access.

Report misconduct or unsafe behaviour via the exchange or by contacting the maintainers at `high_command@shagi.daylands`.
